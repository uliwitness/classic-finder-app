# Classic Mac Finder
> Everything you loved about navigating files on your Macintosh Performa, Quadra, LC or Power Macintosh.

This project aims to be a functional re-creation of the classic Mac OS Finder. 
Now you can experience a pixel-for-pixel clone of the original Macintosh Finder 
on your modern Mac. This application is written in Objective-C and Cocoa.
